So @xawksow and I have been throwing ideas around a new Proof of ______ algorithm that's based on a meritocracy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy

kenel [9:50 AM]9:50
DPoS seems to come the closest to this idea, but I think it has far too many flaws

kenel [9:54 AM]
so.....as I was falling asleep last night, the entire Youtube recommendation algorithm, reward system, etc. kept popping into my head

kenel [9:54 AM]
content uploaders can be rewarded by google based on the # of views they have, and the more content they produce, the more they'll make

kenel [9:55 AM]
the better the content, the more it'll be viewed and the more they will make

kenel [9:55 AM]
it's almost a meritocracy in and of itself

kenel [9:56 AM]
So...what if this concept can be transferred to a Proof of ______ system that rewards people for creating things that get used a lot, or a little; and the better the product, the more it's used, the more they will be rewarded

kenel [9:56 AM]
it takes the human/election factor out of DPoS (which is why I believe this is flawed)

kenel [9:57 AM]
but allows absolutely anyone to come into Switch and create whatever they want and if it gets used, they'll be rewarded

kenel [9:57 AM]
for instance, the wallet developers would likely get rewarded the most as the wallet would be used almost daily by people

kenel [9:58 AM]
what could a system like this be called?.....possibly Proof of Work 2.0, I don't know

kenel [9:58 AM]
but that is our idea in a nutshell

kenel [9:59 AM]
if you created something, it can be linked in the blockchain and verified by (people) similar to how twitter verification works, and with some sort of api or similar the analytics can be transferred back to automatically rank 'delegates' instead of them having to be voted on -- based on usage and verification
